# password-generator


See password generator.jpg

Creates a random password after selecting the password length(8-128 characters), whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters.  I didn't include " as a special character because it messed up my code.   Also, it asks you to select one of each of those types of characters if you choose yes on that character type.  Those chosen characters are appended to the end.  (I couldn't figure out how to get them in randomly. )
